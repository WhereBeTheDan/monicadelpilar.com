I have loved being at LADO since the first day that I arrived as a student. Now as an admissions officer and DSO I use that experience to help more students navigate the ins and outs of living and studying abroad. I register new students, administer placement exams, process payments and applications, and prepare reports among other responsibilities. LADO is a big family that I am proud to be a part of.
